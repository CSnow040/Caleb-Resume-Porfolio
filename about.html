            <h1>My Mission</h1>
            <p>My mission in life as well as in the industry is to be a successful hardworking individual with whatever
                I work on.
                Weather it’s in a group or some separate project I enovate with my fellow peers and make a beautiful,
                spectacular,
                and all around highly functional code to design the website the way the person or company wants it to
                look.
            </p>

            <h1>My Background</h1>
            <p>I was born and raised in Phoenix, Arizona, I am a Greenway High School Graduate of 2020 with an advanced
                diploma.
                During the junior and senior years of my high school experience I attended West-MEC for Coding and that
                was my first
                experience with code and that’s when I finally found out if code was something I wanted to do for the
                rest of my life,
                and to this day I still enjoy coding no matter the language or the difficulty. I am a junior developer
                and I want to
                achieve as much as I can in this industry no matter the cost, because this is my passion.
            </p>

            <h1>My Plans for the future</h1>
            <p>My plans for the future are to go on to be a senior developer for a company that I may find to share the
                same goals
                as me. I plan to be a determined, hardworking, and credible worker for my future jobs and past. No
                matter the objective
                I still find a way to get things done with maximum effort and heart. I promise to be the employee or
                business partner
                you have always wanted and you can count on that.
